Each product has the following properties - name, description, manufacturer, quantity in stock, price per unit. A group of goods contains the following properties - name, description.

## Implement

* The name of the product is unique (it cannot be found in any group of products).
* The name of the product group is unique.
* Add/edit/delete a group of products - when deleting a group of products, delete all products.
* Implement the addition/editing/deletion of a product in a group of products (meaning name, description, manufacturer, price per unit).
* Implement the product addition interface (buckwheat groats arrived in the warehouse - 10 pieces), the product write-off interface (5 buckwheat groats were sold)
* Product search.
* Output of statistical data: output of all goods with information by warehouse, output of all goods by group of goods with information, total cost of goods in stock (quantity * per price), total cost of goods in a group of goods.
