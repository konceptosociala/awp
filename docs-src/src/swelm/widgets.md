# Widgets

Swelm provides a range of widgets for building user interfaces. These widgets 
include buttons for triggering actions, text fields for user input, and containers 
for organizing layout, such as panels and containers. Each widget offers 
specific functionality to enhance the user experience and customize the application interface.

Each widget implements [`AdjustableWidget`](utilities/adjustable-widget.md) interface, so you
can adjust every Swelm widget's size, color etc.
